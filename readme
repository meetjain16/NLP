What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
NLP encompasses a range of techniques and methods designed to analyze and process human language data. Some core aspects of NLP include:
● Text analysis and understanding
● Speech recognition and generation
● Machine translation between languages
● Information extraction from unstructured text
● Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
● Question-answering systems
● Dialogue systems and chatbots
The field has seen remarkable progress in recent years with the development of deep learning approaches, particularly transformer-based models that can capture complex language patterns and relationships.
